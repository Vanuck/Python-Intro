## Exercise 1.2: Data Types in Python

## Reflection Questions

### 1. Imagine you’re having a conversation with a future colleague about whether to use the iPython Shell instead of Python’s default shell. What reasons would you give to explain the benefits of using the iPython Shell over the default one?

- iPython has better interactivity options like syntax highlighting, code completion, built in debugging and other features which can streamline the coding process and improve your productivity.

### 2. Python has a host of different data types that allow you to store and organize information. List 4 examples of data types that Python recognizes, briefly define them, and indicate whether they are scalar or non-scalar.

| Data Type         | Definition                                                        | Scalar or Non-Scalar         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Tuples            | Linear arrays that can store multiple values of any type.         | Non-Scalar                   |
|                   | These are immutable.                                              |                              |
| -----------       | ----------------------------------------------------------        | ----------------------       |
| Integers          | data type represents integers, including both negative and        | Scalar                       |
|                   | non-negative numbers. These are immutable.                        |                              |
| -------------     | ------------------------------------------------------------      | ------------------------     |
| Lists             | Is a type of ordered sequence in Python, similar to a tuple.      | Non-Scalar                   |
|                   | Lists differ from tuples in that they are mutable.                |                              |
| ---------------   | --------------------------------------------------------------    | --------------------------   |
| Dictionaries      | Stores values and objects within itself indexed by identifiers,   | Non-Scalar                   |
|                   | or keys. It’s an unordered set of items, each of them a key-      |                              |
|                   | value pair, where each key is unique. These are immutable.        |                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

### 3. A frequent question at job interviews for Python developers is: what is the difference between lists and tuples in Python? Write down how you would respond.

- The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to lists which are mutable. Therefore, it is possible to change a list but not a tuple. The contents of a tuple cannot change once they have been created in Python due to the immutability of tuples.

### 4. In the task for this Exercise, you decided what you thought was the most suitable data structure for storing all the information for a recipe. Now, imagine you’re creating a language-learning app that helps users memorize vocabulary through flashcards. Users can input vocabulary words, definitions, and their category (noun, verb, etc.) into the flashcards. They can then quiz themselves by flipping through the flashcards. Think about the necessary data types and what would be the most suitable data structure for this language-learning app. Between tuples, lists, and dictionaries, which would you choose? Think about their respective advantages and limitations, and where flexibility might be useful if you were to continue developing the language-learning app beyond vocabulary memorization.
