# Python Intro

# Exercise 1.2

## Exercise goals

- Create a structure named recipe_1 that contains the following keys:
  name (str): Contains the name of the recipe
  cooking_time (int): Contains the cooking time in minutes
  ingredients (list): Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

- Create an outer structure called all_recipes, and then add recipe_1 to it. Figure out what type of structure you would consider for all_recipes, and briefly note down your justification in the README file. Ideally, this outer structure should be sequential in nature, where multiple recipes can be stored and modified as required.

- Make your own recipes too! Generate 4 more recipes as recipe_2, recipe_3, recipe_4, and recipe_5, and then add them as well to all_recipes.

- Print the ingredients of each recipe as five different lists, inside the IPython shell.

## Step 1 : Data structure decsion

- I will be using dictionaries for storing my recipe data. This is due to the flexibility of dictionaries.
  It will give me the ability to store strings, lists & integers. They are also mutable, allowing items to be updated.

## Exercise 1.2 Files:

- Step 1 = Decision on what data structure to use for this app
- Step 2 = recipe_1
- Step 3 = all_recipes with recipe_1 in it
- Step 4 = all_recipes with 5 recipes in total included
- Step 5 = ingredients lists of all 5 recipes

- Learning journal updated
