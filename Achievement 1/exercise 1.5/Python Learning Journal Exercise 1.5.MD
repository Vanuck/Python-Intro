## Exercise 1.5: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## Reflection Questions

### 1. In your own words, what is object-oriented programming? What are the benefits of OOP?

- OOP organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
- OOP benefits: Allows Reuse of Code, Maintains Code Consistently, Ensures Flexibility, Offers Security & Encourages Scalability

### 2. What are objects and classes in Python? Come up with a real-world example to illustrate how objects and classes work.

- In Python OOP is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that manipulates that data. In OOP, objects are created from templates called "classes", which define the properties and behavior of the objects they create.

- Example: An airplane, a class as a blueprint for airplanes. It will define items like wing size, doors, seats, color, etc. It would also have behaviours attached like take off speed, flying, & landing. A Dash8 airplane has specific properties like wing size, color, number of wheels and seating and can do certain things like flight speed, landing speed, etc. Every airplane built for the blueprint will have unique characteristics but share common items with all airplanes of its class.

### 3. In your own words, write brief explanations of the following OOP concepts; 100 to 200 words per method is fine.

- Inheritance: Allows defining of classes to inherit methods and properties from another class. Allows child classes to add existing code from other classes.

- Polymorphism: Using a single item to represent different forms allowing sharing of that method. Example: the + operator is used extensively in Python programs. But, it does not have a one usage, but can be used different ways depending on the need.

- Operator Overloading: Allows the same operator to have a different meaning according to the context. Lets you setup up custom behaviours for normal operators in your objects.
