## Exercise 1.6: Databases in Python

## Reflection Questions

### 1. What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?

- A database allows data to be organized in a structured and consistent manner, making it easy to access and manipulate. It ensures the integrity of the data by enforcing rules on data input and storage, and by tracking changes to the data.

### 2. List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:

- Numeric = FLOAT = Numbers with decimals & INT = Whole numbers
- DATE and TIME = Time-based data using various formats.
- VARCHAR(n) = A string of a variable amount of characters. N = maximum amount of characters

### 3. In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?

- If you have to deal with huge datasets, need multiple user access, and require a dedicated server, then MySQL is a good choice. However, if you are dealing with small datasets and need to perform efficient read and write operations, then SQLite is ideal.

### 4. Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?

- Python is known for data analysis and scientific computing, while JavaScript is more associated with web development. However, both languages are growing and becoming essential in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things.
- Python makes it simple to read and maintain code. Because of its flexibility, Javascript does not provide easy code readability or maintainability.
- To run Python code, you'll almost always need an interpreter. The ability to run Javascript code is built-in to most web browsers.

### 5. Now that you're nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?

- Python’s memory consumption is very high. For that reason, it might not be the best choice for memory intensive tasks.
- Python is not native to the mobile environment and some programmers see it as a weak language for mobile computing. Android and iOS don’t support mobile computing in Python as an official programming language.
- Python does not have the best threading, executing code through multi-threaded CPU-bound programs may be slower than single-threaded ones
- Python is an interpreted language, most find that it is slower than some other popular languages.
