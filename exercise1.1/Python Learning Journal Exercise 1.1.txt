# Python for Web Developers Learning Journal

## Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python

- Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
- Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

## Reflection Questions

1.	In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? 
If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

Front-End Web Development is working with the parts of the web that users see and interact with.

Back-End Web Development is working with the parts of the web that support the front-end in the background, IE: databases, logic items, authentication, authorization, etc.

If hired to work on back end programming I would be working on the APIs, database, storage, access, authentication and authroization parts of web sites.

2. Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future.
Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice.
How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team?
Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 

Python is a high-level scripting language, just like JavaScript, in which commands are executed line by line via standardized syntax.
Python was designed with prototyping and quick deployment in mind, with its most striking feature being readability, 
so that anyone with basic experience in coding can glance at a code snippet and quickly grasp what's actually happening.
Readability is helped by indentation to separate blocks of code. 
Like JavaScript, Python uses easily understandable keywords to make commands and perform tasks (import, return, continue, etc.). 
It also shares with JavaScript dynamic typing, an approach that allows variables to assume any kind of value without producing errors.
Python also has:    Simple Built-In Package Management
                    Out-of-the-Box Essentials  
                    Efficient Development Flow
                    Strong Community Support 
All of these things make Python the better choice.

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement.
You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you.
What do you want to learn about Python? 
What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 
Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

I would like to better understand Python and be able to use its powerful automation and scripting capabilities.
Get to know Python well to add more versatilitiy to my Web Development abilities.
Continue to improve my knowledge in programming and web development to improve my confidence wehn applying for new jobs.
